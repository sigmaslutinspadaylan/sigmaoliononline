The gig economy took off during the pandemic, and numerous options remain to make extra money. Example: One father of a soon-to-be college student partnered with his daughter to deliver meals via Door Dash. He kept track of the pickup and delivery locations, she drove and delivered the food. In the end, she made a little more than $20 per hour.

One of the top benefits of working this kind of “job” is it provides instant cash. Some of the best side hustles include delivering meals from a restaurant, food from a grocery store or tutoring through various online sites or apps.

Another benefit: You do it when you want, and don’t do it if you want a break. Taxes must be paid on this self-employment income, so plan accordingly. But the freedom and flexibility make side hustles a good way to supplement any regular income you may have.
